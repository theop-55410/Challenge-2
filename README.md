# Python loan qualifier test

This is a python command-line interface application that allows users to see qualifying loans from lenders quickly and easily. The application works by taking in a `daily_rate_sheet` of loan criteria from various loan providers, asking the user a number of questions to evaluate their loan eligibility, and then returning to them a list of qualifying loans.

---

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.10 with the following packages:

* fire - For the command line interface, help page, and entrypoint.

* questionary - For interactive user prompts and dialogs
